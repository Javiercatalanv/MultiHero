# MultiHero
MultiHero is an exciting platformer that follows the story of three heroes, each ripped from their own universe and thrown into the abyss known as "The Void", a place where worlds come to an end. In this grim and ever-changing environment, the heroes must join forces to face a powerful villain whose goal is to consume and destroy all existing universes. Each character brings unique abilities, and players must master the combined use of these skills to overcome dangerous challenges, defeat enemies, and solve puzzles. The only hope for these heroes to return to their respective worlds lies in stopping the threat before "The Void" consumes everything, taking with it the last spark of life and hope.
